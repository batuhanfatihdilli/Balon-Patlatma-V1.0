## What Is This Balon Patlatma V1.0 ? ðŸ¤”

- I tried to do something for waste my free time in Unity.
- The game mechanics involve balloons appearing randomly from the bottom of the screen and moving upwards.
- The player tries to click and pop the balloons before they reach the top.
- Balloons get faster every 10 seconds, adding more challenge to the gameplay.
- This is a just little basic game to shoot balloons.
- Feel free to ask any questions regarding the project.

## Preview

- Here is a little part of the game.
